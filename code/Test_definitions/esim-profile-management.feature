Feature: CAMARA eSIM Profile Management API, vwip - Happy Path
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * The target device is reachable (has working IP connectivity) throughout the operation
  # * A valid EID for a device with an eUICC
  # * A valid activation code for downloading an eSIM Profile
  # * A valid ICCID for an existing downloaded eSIM Profile (disabled state)
  # * A valid ICCID for an existing enabled eSIM Profile
  # * A valid operationId from a previously submitted operation
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in esim-profile-management.yaml

  # Success scenarios for POST /retrieve-status

  @esim_profile_retrieveStatus_01_success
  Scenario Outline: Retrieve eSIM Profile status by <identifier_type>
    Given the resource "/esim-profile-management/vwip/retrieve-status"
    And the request body property "$.esimProfile.<identifier_field>" is set to a valid <identifier_type>
    When the request "getEsimProfileStatus" is sent
